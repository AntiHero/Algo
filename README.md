1. *The number sum*    
`[3, 5, -4, 8, 11, 1, -1, 6]`, 10  
Task: check if there are two numbers in an array which sum equals to required, i.e. **11 + (-1) = 10**

2. *Validate subsequence*  
`[5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]`, `[1, 6, -1, 10]`  
Task: check if the second array is a valid subsequence of the first one
